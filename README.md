BinSlayer
=========

This program has been realized for my master thesis project: it allows fast
comparison of binary executables. It is not yet fully functional
mainly due to an issue with the library I used (DyninstAPI) to recover
control-flow of binary executables.

I have planed to keep the development of this project, so I am working on it.

Edit - 16/02/2013: I'm going go on the work on this project. My currently goals are:

- Upgrade to Dyninst8.0.
- Ease installation so that everybody can install BinSlayer easily.
- Add full support for Windows plateforms.
- Add full support for PE32 and PE64 file formats.
- Add support for Mac OS and probably for Mach-O file format.
- Improve code, documentation, ...

After having done that, I will publish the first public release of the tool.
