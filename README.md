BinSlayer
=========

This program has been realized for my master thesis project: it allows fast
comparison of binary executables. It is not yet fully functional
mainly due to an issue with the library I used (DyninstAPI) to recover
control-flow of binary executables.

I have planed to keep the development of this project, so I am working on it.
